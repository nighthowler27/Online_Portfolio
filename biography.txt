Born into a family of artists and dreamers, I was destined to follow in their footsteps. As the middle child of three, I was always the one with a pencil in hand, sketching out my wildest dreams. My passion for visual arts only grew as I got older, and soon I found myself drawn to the world of multimedia arts and information technology. Photojournalism became one of my many interests, and I competed in various competitions throughout my school years. But my interests didn’t stop there. I was also deeply involved in Boy Scouting, where I received numerous awards and achieved the highest attainable rank of Eagle Scout. During my elementary days, I excelled in computers and was able to install programs and even do a clean format for Windows OS at a young age. I also excelled in creative software such as photo, video, and audio editing. Life had other plans for me though, and due to financial challenges, I was unable to pursue my passion for multimedia arts and information technology in college. Instead, I attended a maritime school with the hope of landing a good and high-paying job after completing an associate degree in marine transportation in four years. However, due to a lack of connections and financial support, I wasn’t able to catch my star. But my love for photography never faded, and soon I found myself starting a small photobooth business while also working as a freelance photographer for various events and occasions. My journey has been full of twists and turns, but through it all, my passion for capturing the world through my lens has never wavered.Now, I am trying to cope with what I missed 10 years ago. I am now trying to go back with the track I supposed to go through. I studied webdevelopment, 3D modeling, Graphic Design and many other more.
